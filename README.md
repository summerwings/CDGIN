# Dynamic Correlation-Distance Graph Learning for Treatment Response Prediction from rs-fMRI
Example Code for the paper Dynamic Correlation-Distance Graph Learning for Treatment Response Prediction from rs-fMRI

## Train and Evaluate a Model
Train and evaluate:
> python main_dynamic_sweep.py

In training, our default stream is only based on BOLD-level information, as we proposed in our paper.
